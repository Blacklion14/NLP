# Natural Language Processing

## Definition

Natural Language Processing is a form of AI that gives machines the ability to not just read, but to understand and interpret human language. With NLP, machines can make sense of written or spoken text and perform tasks including speech recognition, sentiment analysis, and automatic text summarization.

Some NLP-based solutions include translation, speech recognition, sentiment analysis, question/answer systems, chatbots, automatic text summarization, market intelligence, automatic text classification, and automatic grammar checking. These technologies help organizations to analyze data, discover insights, automate time-consuming processes and/or gain competitive advantages.

NLP is less expensive and more time-efficient than employing a person, faster customer service response times and Pre-trained machine learning models are widely available for developers to facilitate different applications, making them easy to implement.

## Our Use Case

Here we are using a dataset containing detail of different types of reviews collected by customers of a resturant. There are some good, bad and neutral review of lots of customers
We try to train our model by performing NLP on given dataset to predict whether a particular review is positive or negative. Also find out on which things resturant should work to improve.

## Test Our Model

You can test our model by going to our Google Collab session and upload attached dataset in that session and run all cells to visualize the results.

## Results 

On running the Model you will see simillar results as shown below with our given dataset. If you wish to upload your own dataset you can rename and restructure that dataset as ours and upload it to session to view results.
