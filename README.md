# Natural Language Processing

## Definition

Natural Language Processing is a form of AI that gives machines the ability to not just read, but to understand and interpret human language. With NLP, machines can make sense of written or spoken text and perform tasks including speech recognition, sentiment analysis, and automatic text summarization.

Some NLP-based solutions include translation, speech recognition, sentiment analysis, question/answer systems, chatbots, automatic text summarization, market intelligence, automatic text classification, and automatic grammar checking. These technologies help organizations to analyze data, discover insights, automate time-consuming processes and/or gain competitive advantages.

NLP is less expensive and more time-efficient than employing a person, faster customer service response times and Pre-trained machine learning models are widely available for developers to facilitate different applications, making them easy to implement.

## Our Work

Here in this repository I have implemented Natural Language Processing technique for a different use case and real life computation scenario.
Following is the implementation:
